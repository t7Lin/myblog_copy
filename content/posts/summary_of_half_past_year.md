*Good evening, greetings from Teresa, it's ten minutes to ten. It's in the middle of june. I'm going to write a brief summary of this past half year.
In March,I received news that I had passed the written examination part of the teacher certificate, which is the biggest achievement in the past half year, then I went to Wuhan and spent one week there. Looking for some job opportunities. Finally, two foreign trade companies invited me to an interview, but I turned them down. Staying in the hotel was boring, I decided to go out for a walk in the city along the crowded street and take a look around some parks where the cherry blossoms were blooming.Though I've been in this city for four years, I've never went cycling along the East Lake until I graduated. It's an activity I wanted to try for a long time. So one day when it was sunny, I went for it. Spending a few hours there made my day.The only pity is that I don't live there, otherwise I could ride my bicycle along the East Lake frequently. The last night before I went back home, I went to take a ferry. The ship was crowded with passengers,so I could hardly see the sights along river. The river breeze was pleasant. I felt relaxed on the inside after that week.
Since coming back home in the middle of May, I have been preparing for the interview part of the teacher certificate, it was my first time participating in the interview, I was very nervous. As I went into the classroom, my mind was blank. The whole interview took only twenty minutes. When it was completed,I knew I would get a bad result.As I expected, I didn't pass the interview.
Preparation review:The part I did badly in was vocabulary, it was easy, actually, but I couldn't think of anything at that time. On the other hand, I focused on reading and writing, paying little attention to vocabulary and listening and speaking. I didn't make a specific plan for each area of learning, which led to the lack of key skills when I attended the interview. What's more, I made mistakes with some of the terms I used during my interview.
It's too late today, so much for this, I'm going to sleep now.*
